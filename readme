(Done alone)

Compilation:
	make

Usage:
                Left-clicking and drag to move camera
                Right-click to enable object action
                Arrow buttons to walk around map
 		Space to jump


My project is a 3D simulation of a house and property. 

All objects are loaded from Wavefront .obj files (along with materials/textures from .mtl files). Custom loader written to load these. Objects where edited/created in Blender (an open-source modelling program). Model credits are listed below.

Full-featured scene-graph; all objects, polygon meshes, lights, animation represented as a node.

Animated sun/moon orbits, as well as day/night lighting.

Animation when walking, the player bobs up and down and the walking is done in discrete steps. Animated jumping.

Right-click the button on the floor to switch on/off the ceiling light. Ceiling light is animated.

Collision detection stops the player passing through walls, doors and the fence. The player must jump the fence. Right-click on the door to open. Door opening animation.

All code written modularly - all code past the initialisation.cpp is written such that it can be used dynamically, i.e. to add a shape all that is needed is a single loadObjMesh(..) call in the initialisation code, or for a light, a single addLight(..), a door a single addDoor(..), etc. 

Framerate limited to 30fps.

Sweet cow backdrop.

Warning on compilation are all non-static initializers and extended-list initializers, all safe in C++11.




I put many hours into this - I had to do it alone as I am an exchange student with no connections to the co-hort. I understand that it must be marked as a 2-person group but I believe the final result is still satisfactory.
